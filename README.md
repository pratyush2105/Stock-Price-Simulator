# Stock Price Simulator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Stock Price Simulator! This application utilizes the Random Walk Theory and the Monte Carlo Method to predict the movement of a stock for the current month based on historical data available on yFinance for the previous month. By leveraging these statistical techniques, users can gain insights into possible stock price movements for making informed investment decisions.

## Features

### Random Walk Theory

The Random Walk Theory is a financial theory that suggests stock prices move randomly and are not influenced by past prices. It assumes that future price movements are independent of historical trends, making it a useful model for predicting short-term price fluctuations.

### Monte Carlo Method

The Monte Carlo Method is a simulation technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process with random elements. In the context of the Stock Price Simulator, the Monte Carlo Method generates multiple potential scenarios based on the Random Walk Theory to provide a range of possible stock price movements.

### Data Scraping

The application leverages yFinance, a popular Python library, to scrape the necessary historical data for a particular stock from the previous month. This data includes crucial information such as the stock's daily adjusted closing prices.

### Stock Movement Prediction

Based on the historical data collected from yFinance, the application calculates the possible stock movement for the following month. By analyzing the Adjusted Closing Prices, the simulator generates a set of potential outcomes for the stock's price movement, helping users gain insights into potential investment scenarios.

## Tech Stack

The Stock Price Simulator has been developed using a powerful combination of Python libraries, ensuring accurate data analysis and visualizations.

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the application's logic and data processing.

- **Pandas**: A versatile data manipulation library for handling and analyzing structured data.

- **Matplotlib**: A widely used plotting library for creating various types of charts and visualizations.

- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, providing enhanced visualizations.

- **yFinance**: A popular Python library used for accessing financial market data, including stock prices and historical data.
